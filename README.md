Ribbit is a training project, which i ve built to better understand some programing concepts. The app was built with guidelines from Treehouse platform.


Ribbit is a self-destructing messaging app. Users can send photos and videos to each other which then disappear after 10 seconds.
I used third party Parse backend as software service to maintain users relations, messages and provide analytics about push notifications
and app usage.
I was trying to implement Google Material design guide lines to improve UX.
